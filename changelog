1.1

  Only dependencies that are needed are checked
* The BLASTn directory is redirected correctly

* Prokka Databases are automatiaclly detected, provided Pokka is installed

1.2 (28 jul 2022)

* Added the possibility to use NC or TC cutoffs during the prefiltering instead of evalue

NOTE: This has been added in anticipation of a new database. Using this now on you own database will results in fasta files, but the overview files will not be produced as expected because Metascan needs specific ACC, DESC and NAME fields.
Also, youÄºl have to use it in combinaition with --hmms, otherwise Metascan will try to use databases that do not possess a NT or NC field and quit.

1.3 (may 30 ,2023)

* Changed the database to the 16S_ribosomal_RNA database of NCBI, since this is a lot faster.

* Adapted Metascan for the table2asn of that some NCBI

* Added a template figure for constructing the cycles

1.4 ( jan 24, 2024)

* Created a conda environment
