Due to unforseen Github issues, the original entry can now be found under gcremers/metascan-old

1.1

* Updated dependency check
  Only dependencies that are needed are checked
* The BLASTn directory is redirected correctly

* Prokka Databases are automatiaclly detected, provided Pokka is installed
* Prokka installation is now required when using legacy prokka options   

* an embl file is created for easy upload to ENA

1.2 (28 jul 2022)

* Added the possibility to use NC or TC cutoffs during the prefiltering instead of evalue

NOTE: This has been added in anticipation of a new database. Using this now on you own database will results in fasta files, but the overview files will not be produced as expected because Metascan needs specific ACC, DESC and NAME fields.
Also, youÄºl have to use it in combinaition with --hmms, otherwise Metascan will try to use databases that do not possess a NT or NC field and quit.

1.3 (may 30 ,2023)

* Changed the database to the 16S_ribosomal_RNA database of NCBI, since this is a lot faster.

* Adapted Metascan for the table2asn of that some NCBI

* Added a template figure for constructing the cycles

1.4 (Jan 24, 2024)

* Created a conda environment

* Added beta version for phage recognition

* Added a script to download the databases

* Added a few scripts to retrieve fastas from the data 

1.5 (Oct 15 2024)

* Added annotation for precalled Amino-Acid CDS'

* Added tmpdir option

* Changed the way outdir is handled

* Help function is easier to access

* added --shortid option to reduce headers in fastas 

1.6 (March 17 2025)

* removed the mapping option. There are far more advanced binning applications that will do the mapping along with the binning and report the coverage. Coverage can still be used my Metascan.
